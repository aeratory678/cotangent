# Cotangent

**Cotangent** is a liquid-based audio visualizer that utilizes Catmull-Rom splines to create a smooth, organic ferrofluid-like animation, driven by live audio frequency data. The project features a modern UI, real-time audio upload and playback, and visually appealing frequency-responsive animations.

## Features

- üéµ **Audio Upload & Playback**: Upload your own audio files and watch the visualization react in real time.
- üü¢ **Ferrofluid Visualizer**: A central ferrofluid blob morphs smoothly using Catmull-Rom splines, with lobes and spikes responding to bass, mid, and treble frequencies.
- üìä **Frequency Bars**: Minimalist horizontal bars show the current bass, mid, and treble levels.
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Animation**: Responsive updates and performance-optimized rendering with requestAnimationFrame.
- üåì **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design using CSS, SVG icons, and custom controls.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable Settings**:  Options to adjust sensitivity, rotation speed, and outline display.

## Demo


## How It Works

### Audio Processing

- The `AudioProcessor` class (see `audio-processor.js`) uses the Web Audio API to decode uploaded audio files and extract frequency data via an AnalyserNode.
- Frequency data is split into bass, mid, and treble, which update both the UI bars and the ferrofluid shape.

### Visualization

- The `FerrofluidPhysics` class (see `ferrofluid-physics.js`) maintains a ring of particles forming a shape in the center of the canvas.
- Each frame, the positions of the particles are modified by the current audio band values, creating large lobes (bass/mid/treble) and superimposed small waves.
- The shape outline is rendered using a Catmull-Rom spline for smoothness.

### UI and Controls

- The main interface is in `index.html` and styled with `style.css`.
- UI includes a header, frequency bars, a canvas for the visualizer, and custom audio controls.
- `script.js` coordinates the UI, file uploads, playback controls, and updates the visualization in sync with the audio.
